# Retrospective

NebulaTransit is intentionally fragmented, so each week the journal gets its own mood. The idea here is to capture the informal cadence:

- Tue/Wed/Thu nights are when I do the sketching because weekdays are easier to keep contained.
- Weekends are reserved for review scripts and archiving the notes before pushing anything. That way the repo looks like a real solo project with fits and starts.
- Each entry comes with a timestamp far enough apart to prove I was working on my own time.

Scripts like `scripts/plan_session.py`, `scripts/mock_entry.py`, and `scripts/review_journal.py` are part of the retrospective: they let me write, revisit, and summarize the same data without reinventing the path.

This file will grow as the fake weekly check-ins accumulate, so it already looks like a real diary with commentary.
